# BitCrack

A tool for brute-forcing Bitcoin private keys. The main purpose of this project is to contribute to the effort of solving the [Bitcoin puzzle transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/08389f34c98c606322740c0be6a7125d9860bb8d5cb182c02f98461e5fa6cd15): A transaction with 32 addresses that become increasingly difficult to crack.


### Using BitCrack

#### Usage

Use `cuBitCrack.exe` for CUDA devices and `clBitCrack.exe` for OpenCL devices.

Note for OpenCL builds: the .cl files must be in the same directory as clBitCrack.exe, as these are compiled on the fly.

```
xxBitCrack.exe [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]

Where [TARGETS] are one or more Bitcoin address

Options:

-i, --in FILE
    Read addresses from FILE, one address per line. If FILE is "-" then stdin is read

-o, --out FILE
    Append private keys to FILE, one per line

-d, --device N
    Use device with ID equal to N

-b, --blocks BLOCKS
    The number of CUDA blocks

-t, --threads THREADS
    Threads per block

-p, --per-thread NUMBER
    Each thread will process NUMBER keys at a time

-s, --start KEY
    Start the search at KEY. KEY is any valid private key in hexadecimal format

-r, --range RANGE
    Number of keys to search

-c, --compressed
    Search for compressed keys (default). Can be used with -u to also search uncompressed keys

-u, --uncompressed
    Search for uncompressed keys, can be used with -c to search compressed keys

--list-devices
    List available devices


```

#### Examples


The simplest usage, the keyspace will begin at 0, and the CUDA parameters will be chosen automatically
```
xxBitCrack.exe 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```

Multiple keys can be searched at once with minimal impact to performance. Provide the keys on the command line, or in a file with one address per line
```
xxBitCrack.exe 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH 15JhYXn6Mx3oF4Y7PcTAv2wVVAuCFFQNiP 19EEC52krRUK1RkUAEZmQdjTyHT7Gp1TYT
```

To start the search at a specific private key, use the `-s` option:

```
xxBitCrack.exe -s 6BBF8CCF80F8E184D1D300EF2CE45F7260E56766519C977831678F0000000000 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```


Use the `-b,` `-t` and `-p` options to specify the number of blocks, threads per block, and keys per thread.
```
xxBitCrack.exe -b 32 -t 256 -p 16 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```

Use the `-r` or `--range` option to specify how many keys to search before stopping. For instance, to search up to 1 billion keys from the starting key:

```
xxBitCrack.exe -s 6BBF8CCF80F8E184D1D300EF2CE45F7260E56766519C977831678F0000000000 -r 1000000000
```

Note:

Integer values can be specified in decimal (e.g. `123`) or in hexadecimal using the `0x` prefix or `h` suffix (e.g. `0x1234` or `1234h`)


### Choosing the right parameters for your device

GPUs have many cores. Work for the cores is divided into blocks. Each block contains threads.

There are 3 parameters that affect performance: blocks, threads per block, and keys per thread.


`blocks:` Should be a multiple of the number of compute units on the device. The default is 32.

`threads:` The number of threads in a block. This must be a multiple of 32. The default is 256.

`Keys per thread:` The number of keys each thread will process. The performance (keys per second)
increases asymptotically with this value. The default is 32. Increasing this value will cause the
kernel to run longer, but more keys will be processed.


### Build dependencies

Visual Studio 2017 (if on Windows)

For CUDA: CUDA Toolkit 9.2

For OpenCL: An OpenCL SDK


### Building in Windows

Open the Visual Studio solution.

Build the `clKeyFinder` project for an OpenCL build.

Build the `cuKeyFinder` project for a CUDA build.

Note: By default the NVIDIA OpenCL headers are used. You can set the header and library path for
OpenCL in the `BitCrack.props` property sheet.

### Building in Linux

Using `make`:

Build CUDA:
```
make BUILD_CUDA=1
```

Build OpenCL:
```
make BUILD_OPENCL=1
```

Or build both:
```
make BUILD_CUDA=1 BUILD_OPENCL=1
```
